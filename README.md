## About The Project
This is my project used to complete Intuit Mailchimp's A4A technical assesment. This is a mock service scheduler that handles much like the Apple Genius bar or an old school deli counter where customers are served in order of arrival. This code is written 100% in python. The output shows a second by second counter of what is happening in the shop.
